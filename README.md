# ReadHN

An easy to use, clean Hacker News reader app. This is still very, very early in its development and currently only shows a list of items from the main page. I still have to add the WebViews for each link, comments, and more. 

## TODO:
* add proper refreshing of text cells
* add tab bar controllers for each HN section (show, ask, jobs, etc.)
* add ability to display comments using multi-touch gestures
