# ReadHN

An easy to use, clean Hacker News reader app. This is still very, very early in its development and is awash with issues/bugs. Feel free to send a pull request or open an issue if you find something that doesn't work.


## TODO:
* add ability to view comments
* switch to core data
* add icons to each tab

## Issues:
* have to refresh each time tab is switched or else links may not correspond to title
* links aren't properly cached -- currently using NSUserDefaults
